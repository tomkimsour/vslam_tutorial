# Description

This repository follow [slambook](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook2), a book that goes step by step towards understanding vslam.
The book uses c++ but I want to try going through the book using rust instead.
Also, some c++ libraries might not have an equivalent in rust.

# Depencies equivalent
